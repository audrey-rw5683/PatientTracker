## Personal Motivation
Currently, I work as a data manager for a clinical trial company, and our database is only used to store 
information relevant to the trial, but we don't have a simple tool for researchers to remind them when to 
follow up with patients. 
By using this app, patient data is captured in a timely manner, 
the data obtained is of higher quality, and the results of clinical trials are more credible.
